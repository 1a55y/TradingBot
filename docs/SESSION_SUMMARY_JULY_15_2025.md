# Session Summary - July 15, 2025

## What We Accomplished

### 1. Fixed Critical Pattern Detection Bug
- **Problem**: Bot was finding 0 patterns across all timeframes
- **Root Cause**: Hardcoded 1.5x body size multiplier too strict
- **Solution**: Reduced to 1.2x in `src/core/base_bot.py`
- **Result**: Bot now finding 3 patterns (2 high quality)

### 2. Comprehensive Project Analysis
Created detailed documentation:
- `PROJECT_STATUS_JULY_14_2025.md` - Full project state analysis
- `GITHUB_ISSUES_STATUS_ANALYSIS.md` - Which issues are actually done
- `PATTERN_SENSITIVITY_FIX_PLAN.md` - How to make pattern detection adaptive
- `TRADE_ANALYTICS_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` - Phase 2.5 roadmap

### 3. Started Analytics Foundation
- Created `src/analytics/metrics_calculator.py` - All trading metrics
- Created `src/analytics/database.py` - SQLite schema
- Started `src/indicators/market_context.py` - Volatility analysis

### 4. Fixed Position Validation Error
- Fixed `MIN_POSITION_MNQ` error in data_validator.py
- Bot can now calculate position sizes correctly

## Current Bot Status (as of 00:20 UTC)
- **Running**: Yes ✅
- **Finding Patterns**: Yes (3 found, 2 high quality) ✅
- **Last Signal**: 5 minutes ago
- **Trades Executed**: 0 (still investigating why)
- **Price**: $22,989.75 (MNQ)

## Key Discoveries
1. Many GitHub issues are already implemented
2. Lots of code exists but isn't connected (OrderManager, Analytics)
3. Pattern detection was the main blocker
4. Bot hadn't run for 11 days before today

## Next Priorities
1. Figure out why trades aren't executing despite signals
2. Implement dynamic pattern sensitivity (market_context.py)
3. Connect analytics for self-learning (Phase 2.5)
4. Create proper deployment setup (systemd service)

## Files Created/Modified
- Fixed: `src/core/base_bot.py` (pattern multiplier)
- Fixed: `src/utils/data_validator.py` (position validation)
- Created: 4 documentation files in `/docs/`
- Created: Analytics foundation in `/src/analytics/`
- Started: Market context analyzer

The bot is now operational and finding trading patterns successfully!
