## 3. Working Systems

### Core Trading Infrastructure
- **WebSocket Real-time Data**: ~15 updates/second for MNQ/NQ/MES/ES
- **REST API Integration**: Reliable candle data for pattern detection
- **Multi-Contract Support**: MNQ, NQ, MES, ES, MGC, GC
- **Multi-Timeframe Analysis**: 1m, 5m, 15m, 30m, 1h simultaneous analysis
- **Pattern Detection**: Order blocks, support/resistance levels
- **Risk Management**: Daily loss limits, position sizing, stop loss/take profit

### Data Architecture
- **Hybrid Approach**: REST API for historical candles + WebSocket for real-time execution
- **SignalR Protocol**: Successfully implemented with 0x1e delimiter handling
- **Auto-reconnection**: Robust connection management with exponential backoff
- **Data Validation**: Price and volume validation before processing

### Monitoring & Logging
- **Real-time Status**: JSON files updating every 30 seconds
- **Trade Execution Logs**: Detailed entry/exit analysis with timestamps
- **Performance Metrics**: Win rate, profit factor, drawdown tracking
- **WebSocket Health**: Connection status and tick rate monitoring

## 4. Known Issues

### Minor Issues
1. **Empty Handshake Response**: TopStepX returns `{}` for handshake - handled gracefully
2. **Rate Limiting**: Occasional 429 errors during high-frequency requests - mitigated with backoff
3. **Time Zone Handling**: Some logs show UTC while bot operates in Helsinki time

### Resolved Issues
- âœ… **WebSocket Connection**: Fixed using raw WebSocket with SignalR protocol
- âœ… **Position Query**: Corrected to use `"accountId": id` (singular)
- âœ… **Contract ID Format**: Properly formatted as `CON.F.US.{SYMBOL}.{MONTH}{YEAR}`

## 5. Missing Features

### Phase 2.5 (In Progress)
- ðŸš§ **Self-Learning System**: Pattern performance tracking and optimization
- ðŸš§ **DXY Correlation**: Dollar Index integration for trade filtering
- ðŸš§ **Advanced Analytics**: Sharpe ratio, maximum drawdown calculations

### Phase 3 (Planned)

- ðŸ“… **Liquidity Sweeps**: Market manipulation detection
- ðŸ“… **Terminal Dashboard**: Real-time visual monitoring interface
- ðŸ“… **Multi-Account Support**: Manage multiple TopStep accounts
- ðŸ“… **News Integration**: Economic calendar awareness

## Conclusion

T-BOT has successfully achieved production-ready status with robust real-time data capabilities. The hybrid approach of using REST API for pattern detection and WebSocket for execution timing provides optimal performance. The system is ready for extended paper trading trials before transitioning to live funded accounts.

**Recommendation**: Continue paper trading for 2-4 weeks while implementing Phase 2.5 features and gathering performance data.
