# Multi-Timeframe Analysis Update Summary

## Changes Made to bot_live.py

### 1. Dynamic Contract Selection
- Replaced hardcoded "MGC" references with dynamic contract selection based on config
- Updated WebSocket connection to use `self.contract_id` instead of `self.mgc_contract_id`
- Contract selection now reads from `config.SYMBOL` (MNQ or NQ)

### 2. Multi-Timeframe Analysis Implementation

#### New Methods Added:
- `get_multi_timeframe_candles()`: Fetches candles for all analysis timeframes (1m, 5m, 15m)
- `find_mtf_order_blocks()`: Finds order blocks across all timeframes
- `calculate_mtf_pattern_score()`: Scores patterns with multi-timeframe confluence
- `calculate_trend_alignment()`: Checks if patterns align with trends on multiple timeframes

#### Scoring System:
- Base score from pattern strength (0-3 points)
- Timeframe confluence bonus (up to 2 points per aligned timeframe)
- Trend alignment bonus (weighted by timeframe importance)
- Maximum score capped at 10

#### Timeframe Weights:
- 1m: 0.2 (entry timing)
- 5m: 0.5 (primary analysis)
- 15m: 0.3 (trend confirmation)

### 3. Enhanced Trading Loop
- Now analyzes all three timeframes before making trading decisions
- Selects best pattern across all timeframes based on MTF score
- Logs which timeframe provided the best signal
- Uses primary timeframe (5m) candles for execution

### 4. WebSocket Integration
- WebSocket connection properly handles dynamic contract selection
- Real-time price updates work with both MNQ and NQ contracts
- Maintains compatibility with mock API for testing

### 5. Configuration Updates
- Uses `DEFAULT_POSITION_MNQ` instead of `DEFAULT_POSITION_MGC`
- All position size references updated to use MNQ naming
- Supports dynamic contract switching via config

## Benefits of Multi-Timeframe Analysis

1. **Improved Signal Quality**: Patterns confirmed on multiple timeframes are more reliable
2. **Better Entry Timing**: 1m timeframe helps fine-tune entry points
3. **Trend Confirmation**: 15m timeframe ensures trading with the trend
4. **Reduced False Signals**: Confluence requirements filter out weak patterns
5. **Adaptive Scoring**: Different timeframes contribute based on their reliability

## Testing

The multi-timeframe functionality has been tested with:
- Sample data generation across multiple timeframes
- Pattern detection on each timeframe
- Confluence detection between timeframes
- Scoring system validation

## Next Steps

1. Monitor live performance with multi-timeframe analysis
2. Adjust timeframe weights based on performance data
3. Consider adding more timeframes (30m, 1h) for longer-term trend analysis
4. Implement timeframe-specific pattern parameters
