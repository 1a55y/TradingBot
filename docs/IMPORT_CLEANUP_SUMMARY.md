# Import Cleanup Summary

## Removed Module References
No references to the deleted modules were found in the remaining codebase:
- `bot.py` - Not referenced anywhere
- `bot_realtime.py` - Not referenced anywhere  
- `signalr_client.py` - Not referenced anywhere

## Import Style Guidelines Applied
- All files now follow consistent import ordering
- Added section comments for clarity
- Alphabetized imports within each section
- Used absolute imports for clarity
- Removed any unused imports found

## No Breaking Changes
All import changes are cosmetic and do not affect functionality. The codebase remains fully operational with improved code organization.
