# Documentation Cleanup Summary
*Performed: July 2, 2025*

## Actions Taken

### 1. Archive Documentation
- ✅ Created `Plans/Archive/ARCHIVE_CONTENTS.md` to document archived plans
- ✅ Documented why original plans were archived (over-engineering, pivot to simplicity)
- ✅ Preserved historical plans for future reference

### 2. Moved Implementation Docs
- ✅ Moved `SMC_Strategy.md` → `docs/SMC_STRATEGY_IMPLEMENTATION.md`
- ✅ Moved `Better_Bot_Monitoring_Options.md` → `docs/MONITORING_IMPLEMENTATION.md`
- ✅ These are implementation-specific and belong with other technical docs

### 3. Created Active Plans Summary
- ✅ Created `Plans/ACTIVE_PLANS.md` to clarify which plans are currently active
- ✅ Identified MainPlan/Overall_Plan/Plan.md as the primary reference
- ✅ Noted task management plans as "for reference only"

### 4. Directory Structure After Cleanup

## Recommendations

### Keep Active
1. `Plans/MainPlan/Overall_Plan/Plan.md` - Primary development guide
2. `docs/PROJECT_STATUS.md` - Current status tracking

### Future Cleanup (Optional)
1. Consider removing empty strategy/monitoring folders in MainPlan
2. Consolidate multiple task management options into one if team grows
3. Update file paths in any documentation that references old locations

### Archive Size
- Archive directory is reasonable size (~1MB of text files)
- Contains valuable historical context and future ideas
- No need for further compression or removal

## Benefits of This Cleanup

1. **Clarity**: Clear separation between active plans and historical documents
2. **Organization**: Implementation docs moved to appropriate location
3. **History**: Preserved original vision for future reference
4. **Efficiency**: Developers can quickly find active documentation
5. **Context**: Archive summary explains evolution of the project

## No Changes Made To
- Core source code files
- Test files
- Configuration files
- Log files
- Scripts

This cleanup focused solely on planning and documentation organization.
